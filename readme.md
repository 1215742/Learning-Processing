# Learning Processing

The project files of the exercises that I'm doing while learning Processing.
The sketches are mainly based on the following books:

- the Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman
- Processing. A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists by Casey Reas and Ben Fry

of which I strongly suggest the reading.

The code is provided as is.
